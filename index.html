        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request
        a screen wake lock. Under the right conditions, and if allowed, the
        screen wake lock prevents the system from turning off a device's
        screen.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/screen-wake-lock/issues">subscribe to the
        repository on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Modern operating systems achieve longer battery life by implementing
        aggressive power management, meaning that shortly after the lack of
        user activity, a host device may lower the screen brightness, turn the
        screen off and even let the CPU go into a deep power state, limiting
        power usage as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though this is great for prolonged battery life, it can sometime hinder
        some use cases such as scanning a barcode, reading an ebook, following
        a recipe, presenting to an audience, and so on. See also
        [[[wake-lock-use-cases]]].
      </p>
      <p>
        A wake lock will generally prevent something from happening, but UAs
        (and the underlying OS) may time limit a wake lock given the battery
        status (wall power connected, discharging, low battery level), or even
        disallow wake locks in the case a power saving mode is activated.

        Wake Locks
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines the following <dfn data-export="">wake lock
        type</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A <dfn data-export="">screen wake lock</dfn> prevents the screen
        from turning off. Only visible documents can acquire the screen wake
        lock.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the API, the [=wake lock types=] are represented by the
        {{WakeLockType}} enum values.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Other specifications might define different wake lock types.
      </p>

        Policy control

        The Screen Wake Lock API defines a [=policy-controlled feature=]
        identified by the string `"screen-wake-lock"`. Its [=default
        allowlist=] is `["self"]`.
      </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>
          The <a>default allowlist</a> of `["self"]` allows wake lock usage in
          same-origin nested frames but prevents third-party content from using
          wake locks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party usage can be selectively enabled by adding
          `allow="screen-wake-lock"` attribute to the frame container element:
        </p>
        <pre class="example html" title=
        "Enabling screen wake lock on remote content">
          &lt;iframe src="https://third-party.com" allow="screen-wake-lock"/&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the Screen Wake Lock API can be disabled completely by
          specifying the permissions policy in a HTTP response header:
        </p>
        <pre class="example http" title="Feature Policy over HTTP">
          Permissions-Policy: {"screen-wake-lock": []}
        </pre>

    <section>
      <h3>
        Permissions and user prompts
      </h3>
      <p>
        The [[PERMISSIONS]] API provides a uniform way for websites to request
        permissions from users and query which permissions they have.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>user agent</a> can <dfn data-lt=
        "deny wake lock|denies the wake lock">deny a wake lock</dfn> of a
        particular <a>wake lock type</a> for a particular {{Document}} by any
        implementation-specific reason, such as platform setting or user
        preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is RECOMMENDED that a user agent show some form of unobtrusive
        notification that informs the user when a wake lock is active, as well
        as provides the user with the means to <a>block</a> the ongoing
        operation, or simply dismiss the notification.

      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>platform wake lock</a> can be defined by the underlying platform

        <p>
          The {{WakeLockSentinel/onrelease}} attribute is an <a>event
          handler</a> whose corresponding <a>event handler event type</a> is
          <code>release</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is used to notify scripts that a given {{WakeLockSentinel}}
          object's handle has been released, either due to the
          {{WakeLockSentinel/release()}} method being called or because the
          wake lock was released by the <a>user agent</a>.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
          A {{WakeLockSentinel}} object's handle being released does not
          necessarily mean the <a>platform wake lock</a> for a given <a>wake
          lock type</a> was released. That depends on the <a>platform wake

        Managing Wake Locks
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section applies to each <a>wake lock type</a> equally and
        independently, unless a particular <a>wake lock type</a> is explicitly
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt=
        "acquire wake lock|acquire the wake lock|acquired">acquires the wake
        lock</dfn> by requesting the underlying operating system to apply the
        lock. The lock is considered acquired only when the request to the
        operating system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt=
        "release wake lock">releases the wake lock</dfn> by requesting the
        underlying operating system to no longer apply the wake lock. The lock
        is considered released only when the request to the operating system
        succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wake lock is <dfn data-lt=
        "applicable wake lock|applicability">applicable</dfn> if the state of
        the operating system permits application of the lock (e.g. there is
        sufficient battery charge).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>screen wake lock</a> MUST NOT be <a>applicable</a> after the
        screen is manually switched off by the user until it is switched on
        again.
      </p>
      <aside class="note">
        Whether the wake lock is applicable is a transient condition, e.g. when
        the battery charge is low but then the battery is recharged. So like
        the visibility requirement, this is part of automatic wake lock
        management and not part of the decision process whether to allow or
        deny the wake lock.

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Application of a wake lock causes various device components such as
        display or CPU to operate at higher power levels than they otherwise
        would. This can lead to undesirable and potentially dangerous effects
        such as excessive heating and faster than normal battery charge
        depletion. The latter is particularly relevant to mobile devices which
        may not have a stationary power source readily available. Complete
        battery depletion at an unexpected time can lead to inability of the
        user to make or receive calls and use network services, including the
        emergency call service. Implementations should consider preventing wake
        lock application if they determine that the remaining battery capacity
        is low.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the <a>user agent</a> does not <a>acquire wake lock</a> even
        though a browsing context has requested it, this can be observed by the
        browsing context and can possibly disclose sensitive information about
        the state of the device such as that battery level is low.

        Examples
      </h2>
      <pre class="example js" title="Acquires and releases a screen wake lock">
        function tryKeepScreenAlive(minutes) {
          navigator.wakeLock.request("screen").then(lock =&gt; {
            setTimeout(() =&gt; lock.release(), minutes * 60 * 1000);
          });
        }

        tryKeepScreenAlive(10);
      </pre>
      <p>
        This example allows the user to request a screen wake lock by clicking
        on a checkbox, but updates the checkbox checked state in case the wake
        lock state changes:
      </p>
      <pre class="example js" id="onrelease-example">
        const checkbox = document.createElement("input");
        checkbox.setAttribute("type", "checkbox");
        document.body.appendChild(checkbox);

        const sentinel = await navigator.wakeLock.request("screen");
        checkbox.checked = true;
        sentinel.onrelease = () =&gt; checkbox.checked = false;
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, two different wake lock requests are created and
        released independently:

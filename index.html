      <p>
        This document specifies a JavaScript Web API used to request a screen wake lock on a top-level browsing context. This prevents the device from entering a power-saving state
        (e.g, turning off the screen).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This document is a public working draft of a potential specification. It captures one of the proposals discussed by W3C DAP WG members and decided to start with.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>
        There is a number of use cases for this API:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Applications that don't rely on finger/click based interaction, such as games that use the acceleromenter or voice input;
        </li>
        <li>
          Applications where it's critical for a user to be able to see the informations on screen while they are performing a different task. E.g., an application for preparing meals, or for fixing appliances;
        </li>
        <li>
          Online video services, cinemas etc. - user is watching movie and doesn't interact with screen for a long time, but it is critical to keep screen awake;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The concept <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#browsing-context">browsing context</a> is defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">Promise</a></code> interface
        this specification uses is defined in [[!ECMASCRIPT]].

    <section id="wakelockchanged">
      <h2><code>wakelockchanged</code> event</h2>
      <p>This event is used to communicate wake lock state change or an error in changing state. It is named <b>wakelockchanged</b>. If wake lock is acquired or released for any reason a <a href="#wakelockchanged" class="internalDFN">wakelockchanged</a> event must be sent.</p>
      <p>User agents must deliver this event by <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">queuing a task</a> to <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#concept-event-fire">fire an event</a> of the appropriate name with its <code>WakeLockType</code> attribute set to type of lock being acquired or released.</p>

          Calling this method causes the underlying platform to keep the screen in active state, preventing it from dimming or locking until user unlocks it.

        <dd>
          Calling this method releases the wake lock. The screen will no longer be kept awake and it could switch off again.

    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security considerations</h2>
      <p>The primary use case for this API is to prevent a device from dimming or locking the device screen, as often happens when a device is left without user interactions.</p>
      <p>Keeping the screen from dimming or locking can drain the underlying device power reserve. Preventing it from locking may expose the device and its content to unwanted parties if the user expected it to lock automatically.</p>
      <p>To mitigate the risks mentioned above, user agents may want to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only resolve resulting Promise of <code>navigator.wakeLock.request</code> on visible browsing contexts;</li>
        <li>Do not resolve resulting Promise of <code>navigator.wakeLock.request</code> when the power reserve reaches low levels;</li>
        <li>Alert the user when the first request to lock screen happens, with the option of banning further use of that feature from the given origin;</li>
        <li>Highlight in some way browsing contexts, keeping the screen lock to inform user about it.</li>
    </section>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <pre class="example highlight">
//lock display when the recipe is showing: 
$( "#recipe" ).on( "show", function() {
    navigator.wakeLock.request("screen").then(haveFun, boo) 
} ); 

//release lock: 
$( "#recipe" ).on( "hide", function() {
    navigator.wakeLock.release("screen") 
} ); 
      </pre>
      <p>Example of using wakelockchanged events</p>

    if (locktype === "screen") {
        console.log("Oops, screen wake lock was lost.");

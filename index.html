        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request
        a wake lock. A wake lock prevents some aspect of the device from
        entering a power-saving state (e.g., preventing the system from turning
        off the screen).

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href=

        on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.

        Wake Locks
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>wake lock</dfn> prevents some aspect of the device or operating
        system from entering a power-saving state.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification deals specifically with the screen wake lock which
        prevents the screen(s) of the device from entering a power-saving state.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Extension to Screen interface</h2>
      <p>
        This specification extends <code>Screen</code> interface defined by
        [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] to allow document scripts to inform the browser that
        they prefer to keep the device screen awake:
      </p>
      <dl title="partial interface Screen" class="idl">
        <dt>attribute boolean keepAwake</dt>
        <dd>
          Reflects the state of the <a>wake lock</a> <a>request
          flag</a>.
          Document script can set this attribute to <code>true</code> to
          <a>request wake lock</a> or to <code>false</code> to
          <a>cancel wake lock request</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Requesting Wake Locks</h2>
      <p>
        Each <a>browsing context</a> has a <dfn>request flag</dfn> for the
        <a>wake lock</a>, represented by its <code>screen.keepAwake</code>
        attribute. The request flag is set to <code>false</code> when the
        <a>browsing context</a> is created or its <a>active document</a> is
        changed. Request flags are used by <a>user agent</a> to track if a
        particular document is requesting the lock (for the purpose of
        <a>acquiring</a> or <a>releasing</a> the
        corresponding operating system lock).
      </p>
      <p>
        A document <dfn data-lt="request wake lock">requests wake lock</dfn> by setting
        <a>browsing context</a>'s lock <a>request flag</a>. This means that the
        document indicates to the <a>user agent</a> a preference that the
        underlying operating system apply wake lock, i.e. keep the screen on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A document can successfully request wake lock regardless of whether the
        actual lock can be applied by the <a>user agent</a> and/or the
        underlying operating system at the time when the request is made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, a document <dfn data-lt="cancel wake lock request">cancels wake lock request
        </dfn> by resetting its <a>browsing context</a>'s lock <a>request flag
        </a>. This means that the document indicates to the <a>user agent</a>
        that it no longer prefers that the underlying system apply the wake
        lock.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Setting or resetting a lock <a>request flag</a> merely indicates a
          preference of the document to have the wake lock applied. Requesting
          the lock or cancelling wake lock request does not entail synchronous
          acquisition or release of the corresponding operating system lock, and
          can only result in an error when the document is explicitly prohibited
          form executing those operations by some security mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          No document "owns" the operating system lock and the state of
          operating system lock does not affect the state of the lock request
          flag for any document's <a>browsing context</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, user agent is responsible for mapping the state of request
          flags for all <a>browsing context</a>s to the state the operating
          system lock.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Managing Wake Locks</h2>
      <p>
        <a>User agent</a> <dfn data-lt="acquire|acquiring">acquires</dfn> the wake lock by
        requesting the underlying operating system to apply the lock. The lock
        is considered acquired only when the request to the operating system
        succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt="release|releasing">releases</dfn> wake
        lock by requesting the underlying operating system to no longer apply
        the wake lock. The lock is considered released only when the request to
        the operating system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>browsing context</a> is <dfn>relevant</dfn> to the wake lock if:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Its <a>active document</a> is visible, i.e. it's <a><code>
          visibilityState</code></a> attribute has value of <code>visible</code>
          as defined by [[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]].
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a>browsing context</a>'s wake lock <a>request flag</a> is set.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The <a>wake lock</a> is <dfn>applicable</dfn> if the state of the
        operating system permits application of the lock (e.g. there is
        sufficient battery charge and wake locking is not disabled by a user
        setting).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>User agent</a> MUST <a>acquire</a> the wake lock when
        all of the following conditions become true:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The wake lock is <a>applicable</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is at least one <a>browsing context</a> that is <a>relevant</a>
          to the wake lock.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <a>User agent</a> MUST <a>release</a> the wake lock when any of the
        conditions above become false.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          From the user's perspective, a document which has requested the wake
          lock will no longer cause the lock to be applied if one of the
          following happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser tab or window is closed.
          </li>
          <li>Switching from one tab to another.
          </li>
          <li>Browser is minimized.
          </li>
          <li>Navigating to a different page or reloading a page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Should the tab and/or browser window once again come to foreground,
          the lock will be applied again if it is still requested and the state
          of the operating system permits its application.
        </p>

      <h2>Additional lock types</h2>
      <p>
        The lock request and management mechanism presented in this document can
        be extended to support additional types of locks by adding new lock
        request flags to appropriate interface objects. E.g. a "system" wake
        lock could be introduced which would prevent the device's cpu, radio(s),
        and other system services from entering a power-saving state while
        allowing the screen to switch off.

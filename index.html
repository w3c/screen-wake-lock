        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request
        a wake lock. A wake lock prevents some aspect of the device from
        entering a power-saving state (e.g., preventing the system from turning
        off the screen).

        Wake Locks
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>wake lock</dfn> prevents some aspect of the device or operating
        system from entering a power-saving state.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification deals specifically with the screen wake lock which
        prevents the screen(s) of the device from entering a power-saving state.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Extension to Screen interface</h2>
      <p>
        This specification extends <code>Screen</code> interface defined by
        [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] to allow document scripts to inform the browser that
        they prefer to keep the device screen awake:
      </p>
      <dl title="partial interface Screen" class="idl">
        <dt>attribute boolean keepAwake</dt>
        <dd>
          Reflects the state of the <a>wake lock</a> <a>request
          flag</a>.
          Document script can set this attribute to <code>true</code> to
          <a>request</a> wake lock or to <code>false</code> to
          <a>cancel</a> wake lock request.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Requesting Wake Locks</h2>
      <p>
        Each <a>browsing context</a> has a <dfn>request flag</dfn> for the
        <a>wake lock</a>, represented by its <code>screen.keepAwake</code>
        attribute. The request flag is set to <code>false</code> when the
        <a>browsing context</a> is created or its <a>active document</a> is
        changed. Request flags are used by the <a>user agent</a> to track if a
        particular document is requesting the lock (for the purpose of
        <a data-lt="acquire">acquiring</a> or <a data-lt="release">releasing</a>
        the corresponding operating system lock).
      </p>
      <p>
        A document <dfn>requests wake lock</dfn> by setting
        <a>browsing context</a>'s lock <a>request flag</a>. This means that the
        document indicates to the <a>user agent</a> a preference that the
        underlying operating system apply wake lock, i.e. keep the screen on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A document can successfully request wake lock regardless of whether the
        actual lock can be applied by the <a>user agent</a> and/or the
        underlying operating system at the time when the request is made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, a document <dfn>cancels wake lock request
        </dfn> by resetting its <a>browsing context</a>'s lock <a>request
        flag</a>. This means that the document indicates to the <a>user
        agent</a> that it no longer prefers that the underlying system apply the
        wake lock.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Setting or resetting a lock <a>request flag</a> merely indicates a
          preference of the document to have the wake lock applied. Requesting
          the lock or cancelling wake lock request does not entail synchronous
          acquisition or release of the corresponding operating system lock, and
          can only result in an error when the document is explicitly prohibited
          from executing those operations by some security mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          No document "owns" the operating system lock and the state of
          operating system lock does not affect the state of the lock request
          flag for any document's <a>browsing context</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, the user agent is responsible for mapping the state of
          request flags for all <a>browsing context</a>s to the state the
          operating system lock.

      <h2>Managing Wake Locks</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt="acquire">acquires</dfn> the wake
        lock by requesting the underlying operating system to apply the lock.
        The lock is considered acquired only when the request to the operating
        system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt="release">releases</dfn>
        wake lock by requesting the underlying operating system to no longer
        apply the wake lock. The lock is considered released only when the request
        to the operating system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>browsing context</a> is <dfn>relevant</dfn> to the wake lock if:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Its <a>active document</a> is visible, i.e. its <a><code>
          visibilityState</code></a> attribute has value of <code>visible</code>
          as defined by [[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]].
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a>browsing context</a>'s wake lock <a>request flag</a> is set.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a>browsing context</a> is either a <a>top-level browsing context
          </a> or its <a>active document</a> has the same <a>origin</a> as the
          active document of its top-level browsing context.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          The same-origin requirement prevents unauthorized nested third-party
          content from requesting a wake lock on behalf of the top-level page.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative approach could be requiring a permission as defined in
          [[!PERMISSIONS]] which would effectively delegate decisions about
          wake lock in nested browsing contexts to the <a>user agent</a>.
          The downside is that permission inheritance model is currently
          non-portable between implementations and sometimes inconsistent even
          within the same implementation. For more details see e.g. this
          <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaocsSuVrU11FFzZwy7EnJNOwxhAHMroWSOEERw5hO0/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1#"
          >Chromium design document</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The <a>wake lock</a> is <dfn>applicable</dfn> if the state of the
        operating system permits application of the lock (e.g. there is
        sufficient battery charge and wake locking is not disabled by a user
        setting).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>acquire</a> the wake lock when
        all of the following conditions become true:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The wake lock is <a>applicable</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is at least one <a>browsing context</a> that is <a>relevant</a>
          to the wake lock.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>release</a> the wake lock when any of the
        conditions above become false.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          From the user's perspective, a document which has requested the wake
          lock will no longer cause the lock to be applied if one of the
          following happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser tab or window is closed.
          </li>
          <li>Switching from one tab to another.
          </li>
          <li>Browser is minimized.
          </li>
          <li>Navigating to a different page or reloading a page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Should the tab and/or browser window once again come to foreground,
          the lock will be applied again if it is still requested and the state
          of the operating system permits its application.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Additional lock types</h2>
      <p>
        The lock request and management mechanism presented in this document can
        be extended to support additional types of locks by adding new lock
        request flags to appropriate interface objects. E.g. a "system" wake
        lock could be introduced which would prevent the device's cpu, radio(s),
        and other system services from entering a power-saving state while
        allowing the screen to switch off.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Application of a wake lock causes various device components such as
        display or CPU to operate at higher power levels than they otherwise
        would. This can lead to undesirable and potentially dangerous effects
        such as excessive heating and faster than normal battery charge
        depletion. The latter is particularly relevant to mobile devices which
        may not have a stationary power source readily available. Complete
        battery depletion at an unexpected time can lead to inability of the
        user to make or receive calls and use network services, including the
        emergency call service. Implementations should consider preventing
        wake lock application if they determine that the remaining battery
        capacity is low.

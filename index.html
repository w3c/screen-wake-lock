        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request
        a wake lock. A wake lock prevents some aspect of the device from
        entering a power-saving state (e.g., preventing the system from turning
        off the screen).

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/wake-lock/issues">subscribe to the repository
        on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Modern OSs achieve longer battery life by implementing aggressive power
        management, meaning that shortly after the lack of user activity, a
        host device may lower the screen brightness, turn the screen off and
        even let the CPU go into a deep power state, allowing to sip as little
        power as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though this is great for prolonged battery life, it can sometime hinder
        good, valid use-cases such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use turn-by-turn navigation while walking and driving and not
        interacting with the phone.
        </li>
        <li>Allow an external device to read a boarding card with a barcode on
        a phone.
        </li>
        <li>Showing a presentation where each slide is shown for a prolonged
        period.
        </li>
        <li>Perform longer computations before the device goes into deep sleep
        mode, such as media processing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More use-cases can be found in <a href=
        "https://w3c-webmob.github.io/wake-lock-use-cases/">Use Cases and
        Requirements</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wake lock will generally prevent something from happening, but UAs
        (and the underlying OS) may time limit a wake lock given the battery
        status (wall power connected, discharging, low battery level), or even
        disallow wake locks in the case a power saving mode is activated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any active wake lock MUST also prevent the page from entering UA
        induced <a data-cite="page-lifecycle#frozen">CPU suspension</a> as
        defined by [[PAGE-LIFECYCLE]].
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification defines the following <dfn>wake lock types</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A <dfn>screen wake lock</dfn> prevents the screen from turning off.
        Only visible documents can acquire the wake lock.
        </li>
        <li>A <dfn>system wake lock</dfn> prevents the CPU from entering a deep
        power state. This may also prevent communication chips such as cellular
        or Wi-Fi from sleeping.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <aside class="note">
        Though a <a>system wake lock</a> will usually keep the network
        connection alive, it is most likely not required for such. Audio
        streaming on devices usually does the same and if you need it for long
        running upload and download tasks, such as for a podcast, other more
        appropriate features exist, like [[BACKGROUND-FETCH]].
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        One type of wake lock can imply the effects of another: for example,
        screen wake lock logically implies that the program which displays
        information on the screen continues running, as if the system wake lock
        were also applied. But to avoid dependence on such implementation
        details which may not always be true, this specification treats all
        types of wake locks as independent.
      </aside>
      <p>
        A <a>user agent</a> can <dfn data-lt="deny wake lock">deny a wake
        lock</dfn> of a particular <a>wake lock type</a> for a particular
        {{Document}} by any implementation-specific reason, for example, a user
        or platform setting or preference.

        The Wake Lock API defines a <a>policy-controlled feature</a> identified

        `["self"]`.
      </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>
          The <a>default allowlist</a> of `["self"]` allows wake lock usage in
          same-origin nested frames but prevents third-party content from using
          wake locks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party usage can be selectively enabled by adding
          `allow="wake-lock"` attribute to the frame container element:
        </p>
        <pre class="example html" title="Enabling wake-lock on remote content">
          &lt;iframe src="https://third-party.com" allow="wake-lock"/&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the wake lock feature can be disabled completely by
          specifying the feature policy in a HTTP response header:
        </p>
        <pre class="example http" title="Feature Policy over HTTP">
          Feature-Policy: {"wake-lock": []}

        release a wake lock.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>platform wake lock</a> can be defined by the underlying platform
        (e.g. in a native wake lock framework) or by the user agent, if it has
        direct hardware control.

        The additional visibility requirement for screen wake lock is to
        prevent keeping the screen on when the page is not visible, such as
        when the browser is minimized. As this condition is transient and not
        under control of the web page, the specification chooses to
        automatically acquire and release the lock when visibility changes
        rather than having the page to deal with it, e.g by re-requesting the
        lock each time the page becomes visible again.

        Managing Wake Locks
      </h2>
      <p data-tests=

        This section applies to each <a>wake lock type</a> equally and
        independently, unless a particular <a>wake lock type</a> is explicitly
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt=
        "acquire wake lock|acquire the wake lock|acquired">acquires the wake
        lock</dfn> by requesting the underlying operating system to apply the
        lock. The lock is considered acquired only when the request to the
        operating system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the <a>user agent</a> <dfn data-lt=
        "release wake lock">releases the wake lock</dfn> by requesting the
        underlying operating system to no longer apply the wake lock. The lock
        is considered released only when the request to the operating system
        succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wake lock is <dfn data-lt=
        "applicable wake lock|applicability">applicable</dfn> if the state of
        the operating system permits application of the lock (e.g. there is
        sufficient battery charge).
      </p>
      <p data-tests="wakelock-applicability-manual.https.html">
        The <a>screen wake lock</a> MUST NOT be <a>applicable</a> after the
        screen is manually switched off by the user until it is switched on
        again. Manually switching off the screen MUST NOT affect the
        <a>applicability</a> of the <a>system wake lock</a>.
      </p>
      <aside class="note">
        Whether the wake lock is applicable is a transient condition, e.g. when
        the battery charge is low but then the battery is recharged. So like
        the visibility requirement, this is part of automatic wake lock
        management and not part of the decision process whether to allow or
        deny the wake lock.

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Application of a wake lock causes various device components such as
        display or CPU to operate at higher power levels than they otherwise
        would. This can lead to undesirable and potentially dangerous effects
        such as excessive heating and faster than normal battery charge
        depletion. The latter is particularly relevant to mobile devices which
        may not have a stationary power source readily available. Complete
        battery depletion at an unexpected time can lead to inability of the
        user to make or receive calls and use network services, including the
        emergency call service. Implementations should consider preventing wake
        lock application if they determine that the remaining battery capacity
        is low.
      </p>
      <p data-tests="wakelock-state-is-global.https.html">
        The ability to observe the global state of a wake lock can create a
        communication channel between two otherwise isolated {{Document}}
        objects. One document can request wake lock which changes the global
        wake lock state, and another document can observe this change by
        subscribing to events in {{WakeLock}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the <a>user agent</a> does not <a>acquire wake lock</a> even
        though a browsing context has requested it, this can be observed by the
        browsing context and can possibly disclose sensitive information about
        the state of the device such as that battery level is low.
